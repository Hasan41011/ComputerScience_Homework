                                                                                    Tutorial 1

                                                                                    Data types

    1. Define each data type, and give an example.
        a) Integer
            • Integer is a number without a decimal point. 1 is an example of an integer.
        b) Floating Point
            • Floating point is a decimal number. 1.0 is an example of a floating point.
        c) String
            • String is a set of characters in a speech mark. “Hello World” is an example of a string.

    2. What data type is each value? Use the type function type to verify.
        a) 3: integer
        b) 4.5: float
        c) 6.0: float
        d) “hello”: string
        e) “3.14159”: string
        f) Math.pi: function

    3. Use the type function to identify the data type of each result. Are there any that do not work?
        a) 3 + 7: 10
        b) 5 + 6.0: 11.0
        c) 6 / 3.0: 2.0
        d) 6.0 // 3.0: 2.0
        e) “Py” + “thon”: Python
        f) “High” + 5: Does not work

    4. Which variable names are acceptable, and which are not? If a variable name is unacceptable, explain why.
        a) num: acceptable
        b) AGE: acceptable
        c) FiRsTnAmE: acceptable
        d) _count: acceptable
        e) 2nd_card: unacceptable
        f) card_2: acceptable
        g) card 2: unacceptable
        h) lambda: acceptable

    5. Choose a meaningful variable name to represent each scenario.
        a) The number of cards dealt to a player: num_card
        b) An employee’s monthly salary: mth_salary
        c) The sum of the values rolled by two dice: sum_values
        d) The temperature on a hot summer day: temp_day

    6. Assign the value x = ‘house’, y = ‘boat’ and z = ‘ha’. What is the result of each statement? Which do not work, and why?
        a) x + y: houseboat
        b) y + x: boathouse
        c) z * 3: hahaha
        d) z * x: It does not work as you cannot multiply a string.
        e) x + 2: It does not work as you cannot add a string with an integer.
        f) y + “2”: boat2

    7. Assign the values base = 10 and height = 5. Calculate the area of a triangle using the formula A = ½ (b) (h), and assign the value to the variable area. Echo this value.
            • base = 10
            height = 5

            area = (1/2) * base * height

            print(area)

    8. Execute the following sequence of commands in the shell, then state the final value of k.
            k = 7
            k += 3
            k *= 2
            k -= 5
            k //= 6

            • 2

    9. Explain why the following run-time error occurs.
        &gt;&gt;&gt; number = 8
        &gt;&gt;&gt; Number += 1
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File “&lt;pyshell&gt;”, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
        NameError: name ‘Number’ is not defined

            • This run-time error occurs because the person assigned value for ‘number,’ and then changed the variable to ‘Number.’ The first variable had small ‘n,’ whereas the second time when the person wrote the variable, he/she wrote it with capital ‘N.’



    1. Write a program in Python language that asks the user to enter their name and display their name with a welcome message!

            • name = input('What is your name? ')
            print(f'Hello, {name}')

    2. Write a program in Python that asks the user to enter two numbers a and b and display their sum: a + b

            • number_1 = int(input('What is the first number? '))
            number_2 = int(input('What is the second number? '))
            print(f'The sum of the first and second number is {number_1 + number_2}')
